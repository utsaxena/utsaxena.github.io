I am  a PhD candidate in public policy at the University of Oxford, supported by the Clarendon scholarship at St. John's college. I completed a master of laws from Harvard Law School as an Inlaks scholar and a master in international development economics from Harvard Kennedy School as a John M. Olin Fellow. I was previously a law clerk and practicing attorney at the Supreme Court of India and a consultant with the Chief Economic Advisor of India, the World Bank, and the Boston Consulting Group. I am interested in development and environmental economics.
